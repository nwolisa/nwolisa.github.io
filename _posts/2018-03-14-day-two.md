“I made a remarkable discovery, which is that you can’t eat ice cream that’s not in your freezer.”

This may not exactly seem like a newsflash, but coming from cognitive scientist Art Markman, it's actually a profound insight. As he tells Srinivas Rao, old habits are hard to break because our environment readily allows us to continue them. After all, if there's a pint of Ben & Jerry's in your freezer, sooner or later, you're probably going to eat it.

But if you start by changing your environment, your habits will follow suit. And before you know it, you'll be living the new lifestyle you've always hoped for.

So back to the question how do  you look out for Integrity? Find out what's in their freezer :)
