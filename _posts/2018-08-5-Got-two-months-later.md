What am I going to write on each day?

The secret to consistency in Life is understanding why? You have to have a reason for doing what you do. Sometimes it is said that you should love what you do. I totally agree with that. But I feel that a higher level is to understand why you are doing what you are doing. 

Purpose is stronger than all other emotion. When Purpose is unknown, Abuse is inevitable. 

Always be willing to be the person to ask Why?

Ask and it shall be given? 

Questions is the proof of pursuit. Pursuit is the proof of passion and desire. Ask the right question. Ask the not so right question. Question the question. Keep a curious mind. No assumption is allowed. We either know why or we ask why. 

There once was a time when curiousity killed the cat. It probably killed the cat, but I don't know a human that curiosity has killed. :) Ask the question and get good at asking the right questions. But don't stop asking because answers are the guide way to success.
