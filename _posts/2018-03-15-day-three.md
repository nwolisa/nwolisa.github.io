I was diligent. I had a plan. I wanted to jog 3 times a week for 1km. I started out well. Actually, too well. I was jogging 4 times a week averaging 2kms on each jog. 

Then I read that jogging every morning was a waste of time. Mornings are suppose to be your most creative period and it didn't make sense to spend your most productive period on something as mundane as exercising. Furthermore, the article argued, there are studies to show that exercising is most effetively after one had eaten and any time in the Afternoon. 

Who won't like to be productive?

I ditched my exercise routtne and never bothered. Until today.

I have had the inspiration to start again. And now I have. 

My stats: 
* Wednesday Morning Run
* 14 March 2018 5:59 am
* Distance 1.32 Km
* Duration 14.44
* Calories 80 
* Pace 11:09 Min/Km
