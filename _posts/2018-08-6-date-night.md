Gee: Do have a book in mind
M: I got one by a lady called Mindy Kaling. I liked the way the book is written (what I’ve read so far is also nice)
Gee: Good!

Gee: What's date night?
M: A time you and your wife carve out time so that you can go on a date, (it has to be regular and frequent for it to be called date night)
Gee: interesting... How frequent? Seriously we don't have anything like that 😢 Could you tell me more about it?
M: So do you take your wife out on dates?
Gee: Once in a while
M: *trying to approach it from a different angle cause I suspect we have different terminologies for it
M: Is it at least every fortnight?
M: The point of date night is usually to go on a date and just enjoy each other’s company outside of the house. But it has to be at least every fortnight
Gee: Sounds like an interesting idea.
Gee: Honestly I don't do it. But it sounds like something we should start doing. Thanks.
M: Yes, make her feel like the gal you were hitting on back in the day. You can even place a request that she wears a certain dress that you like 😉
Gee: 😍 Nice!!!!
Gee: What day would you advice. I am thinking every Friday night or is that too regular?
M: No it’s not. That’s the ideal. Then even once in a while it can be her turn to treat you (depending on how you guys manage your finances). This way when the kids come it’s easy for you guys to still make time for yourselves since you had the routine going
Gee: 😊 But is there ever a risk of it being too routine. Is the mixture of the type of event going to be helpful?
M: Definitely
Gee: So true. I always worry about what kids would do to our relationship
M: Just make it frequent and deliberate
M: No slack/WhatsApp during that time
M: 😝
M: Just you and her
Gee: Do I slack/Whatsapp alot? 🤔
M: you tell me
Gee: No I don't
Gee: Thanks for this very amazing tips my dear good friend.... You just lit a light for us
M: That’s what family friends are for 😂
Gee: Hahahaha. You truly are a good friend. Keep it up 😊
Gee: So I plan to start this week. I will take her out to see a movie. Does that qualify?
M: Yes it qualifies And it’s a great start. But you have to be consistent even when you are mad at each other and don’t want to talk

M: It’s that time of the evening where we love, time for me to get offline 
I’m starting on that no-gadget policy in bed tonight and read my book. Enjoy your Sunday, I’ll definitely be streaming the sermon live ☺
