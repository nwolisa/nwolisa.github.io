 # If I had to join in a challenge, what will it be?
 
 * Run a marathon?
 * Code every day and commit every day to GitHub?
 * Write every day? Or simply write a journal every day?
 * Commit to a diet and do it daily?
 * Drink 10 cups of water every day?
 * Read some pages of a book every day?

 Notice I just kept going on about things I will do daily.
 Would it be less of a challenge if the activity is bi-weekly, monthly or any other frequency other than daily? 

 Would I do a health check every 3 months?
 Quarterly, I would build something
 I would read a book bi-weekly
 I would learn a new skill every month
