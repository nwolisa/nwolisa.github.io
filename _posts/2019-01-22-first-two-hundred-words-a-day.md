3:50 AM

I just woke up from a 7-hours sleep. It is great to have finally slept for 7 straight hours.

I planned waking up earlier. My wife and I both came back tired and planned to work at night. My alarm was set for 10pm but I guess I either snoozed it when it rang or just slept through the ringing of the phone.

Now I am on my Macbook. I am getting done some of the work from yesterday.  
Late yesterday, I got the emails from the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) that my business name registrations were successful. I still am excited about it. I took a leap of faith when I used the CAC's online services and it was completely worth it. It cost me about 75% less than if I had used a 3rd party service. 

This is the second time I am using a government online service and both times I have been pleasantly surprised. The first was the Federal Road Service Corps online registration service for renewing my driver licence. Not only did it work and was cheaper, but the entire process also was not close to the horror stories that I had heard about the registration and renewal process.
