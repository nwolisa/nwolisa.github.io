Three months later and still no consistency in my blogging. 

Do I just give up and go home? 
No I won't. Just a plan of action is needed. 
This is one the item on my coaching list. If all fail, try coaching. Try to use external motivator. Try asking someone to keep you accountable. Would it work this time? 

I am not sure. One big issue that still remains is what am i going to blog on?

That doesn't mean I don't know what to write on, it just means what it means, what do I write on. 

Let's keep at it!!!
